OpenHCM Web Viewer
==================


The OpenHCM Standard
--------------------
OpenHCM is an industry-driven XML-based file format to store ship structure and condition of the hull. The format is maintained and promoted by the OpenHCM Consortium which comprises several major class societies as well as CAD vendors and other technology leaders in the maritime industry.


The Viewer
----------
The OpenHCM Web Viewer was developed by [Bureau Veritas](http://www.bureauveritas.com) in order to promote the format and demonstrate its features. It is now released under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) in order to encourage its use and evolution, as well as offer a sample implementation for future OpenHCM-supporting software.
